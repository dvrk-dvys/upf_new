I didn’t get what I was promised.
My package hasn’t arrived yet.
No one in your team has been able to solve my problem.
I was put on hold for an hour!
Why is this so hard to use?
Why does it fail so easily?
Hate the way you never let me in
You always home, but still I felt alone
Hate your friends the ones who all chimed in
Like we were trivia, something to weigh up
I hate it that you know just when I hold my waist
I hate that I can't breathe when someone else says your name
I hate it when you call just when I'm doing okay
I wish I hated you, oh, I hate it, I hate it
I hate that you call me emotional
I hate that you laugh when I'm all in a huff
I hate you for the things you said to me
The first time we broke up, memorised every part
I hate it that you know just when I hold my waist
I hate that I can't breathe when someone else says your name
I hate it when you call just when I'm doing okay
I wish I hated you, oh I hate it, I hate it
I hate that I see you like everywhere
I hate that you finally cut your hair
I hate that you're doing all the things
I asked now that we're over
I hate our friends that I see you with
I hate that you're getting away with shit
I hate that I can't just get up and move past
Oh, I hate it, I hate it
I hate it that you know (just when I hold my waist)
I hate that I can't breathe (when someone else says your name)
I hate it when you call (just when I'm doing okay)
I wish I hated you, oh I hate it, I hate it
I hate it that you know
I hate that I can't breathe (when someone else says your name)
I hate it when you call
I dont like the experience of this
I get a lot of bad emotions
I cant do this right now
I have absolutely zero interest
I need something much faster
I want to speak to a human
I hate robots
Why do I have to do this
There must be an easier way
I need to find a way not to do this
My wife cannot do this
We only want to speak to the staff
I will not subject myself to this
I am above this nonsense
What is this nonsense
Can't believe they force people to do this
I am way too tired for this
I just came here to get some food and leave
I just want to go to the cafe
I am in need of other services
Can you just leave me alone
Art is really lame
Can someone get me out of this
Can someone help me please
I dont wanna do this anymore
please get away from me
I need you to be quiet
Can you shut up
When will this stop
Get me out of here
Im not listening
I am not talking to you
I'm so over it.
Don't ask me that again.
I thought I wouldn't have to do this
I would pay for you to leave me alone.
The last time we did this it failed.
The last exhibition was so bad I cried.
I have no more interest in this museum.
I wouldn't ever come here again even if you paid me.
My kids got hurt and scared last time.
My family will never come here again, remember that!
I cannot believe you just said that to me.
I am offended.
