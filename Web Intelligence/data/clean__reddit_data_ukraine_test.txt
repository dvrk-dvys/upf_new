  - "Logistical problems continue to beset Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine."
  - "Reluctance to manoeuvre cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel."

It is remarkable how many Russians are trying to win back some sympathy by saying they are against the war. That should be the default human response. In Chris Rock voice “What do you want, a cookie?”. Bravo for not being a literal fascist.
But if you ask that same Russian who should Crimea belong to and hear back anything other than “to Ukraine”, than you know you are dealing with a lying POS who only pretends to be on the right side of history when it started hurting them personally. 
Many *woke* Russians still don’t understand how this whole war started with the Crimea land grab and why it will not be over until it is returned.
Putin will hang from a rope.
I know I could lend a hand in aid. Im a first responder and was minimally trained in combat for a security job I had years back, so I feel confident enough in my abilities to help in any way I could be utilized. Im awaiting word back for my interview with the Defense Attaché. 
I hope this doesnt come off as just paying lip service or disrespectful. There hasnt been a cause like this Ive been willing to fight for my entire life. Even if I can help one person it will be entirely worth it. I hope Im taken in consideration as the world needs to have your back in every capacity imaginable. Please, if youre willing to fight, please sign up.
History is on your side. Slava Ukraini.
Edit: I understand how this can come across as "attention seeking" but just know my only intention is to show support and if I have any "ulterior motive" its to convince others to do the same and join if they are able.

The House passed legislation Thursday that would suspend normal trade relations with Russia, a move designed to further isolate Moscow’s economy in response to President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.
The measure passed 424-8, with all opposition coming from Republicans.
The bill would revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status in the World Trade Organization and pave the way for President Joe Biden to introduce higher tariffs on Russian goods such as steel, aluminum and plywood. It’s the latest in a series of punitive actions in coordination with the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial nations after Russia invaded Ukraine last month.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., praised passage of the legislation, which would also affect Belarus, a Russian ally.
“As Russia continues its horrific, unprovoked war on the Ukrainian people, the House is moving to inflict even greater economic pain on Russia and Belarus,” he said in a statement.
Opposition to the bipartisan bill came from GOP Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on lawmakers to do more to help thwart Putin’s invasion Wednesday in a virtual address to Congress.
“Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided, the destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy,” Zelenskyy said from Kyiv.
The Biden administration has imposed a series of punitive measures to block imports of Russian oil and gas, among other goods, in coordination with the . But Zelenskyy has said he needs allies to take military steps to protect Ukraine, such as imposing a no-fly zone over parts of the country and providing fighter jets.
The trade suspension bill now heads to the Senate. Biden is expected to sign it when it reaches his desk.
Earlier Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-., said the Senate would quickly take up the bill.
“Both parties — Democrat and Republican — remain united in sending Putin a clear message: His inhumane violence against the Ukrainian people will come at a steep price,” he said from the Senate floor. “I will work with my colleagues to move it through this chamber quickly.”
More than 320,000 of our compatriots have already returned to Ukraine, most of them men.
This was reported by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
"More than 320,000 Ukrainian citizens, the vast majority of whom are men, have returned home since the beginning of Russias open armed aggression against Ukraine," the statement said.
The press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs also quotes one of the Ukrainians, who came from Poland to his homeland to help his brothers.
"Our guys do not give up, so we need to help, we need to fight for our country. Ukraine must be free, like all people, "he said.

Hello r/ukraine users!
A few hours ago, a (now former) r/ukraine moderator went rogue and removed many of the active mods in our subreddit and removed mod permissions for the rest of them, going as far as banning them or adding his friends. We immediately called upon Reddit admins and u/Nestor_Sem, the top level moderator, to take action against the moderator in question. Thankfully, Nestor answered us and removed the mod in question.
This has been incredibly stressful for the moderation team, but we thank for all the support you gave us in this short span of time.
We will continue enforcing the rules, allow for sharing of news and footage about the war in Ukraine, discussion (*but please we dont care about Tucker Carlson*), adding links to trusted charities, among other things. Theres a lot of work to do.
Nestor also asked to share the following message:
&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; Thank you for quickly notifying me about what has transpired over the last 6 hours with [mod name]. I have made the appropriate changes to the moderators list and removed the COMEBACKALIVE charity post.
&gt; We as the mods need to be as impartial as possible when it comes towards providing any sort of approved posts, especially when it comes to providing a donation link for the community during this crisis. I want this to be heard loud and clear, there is never to be a single approved option that the moderators prefer. In the event we choose to do a Charity post, multiple approved, confirmed and vetted links need to be provided. This allows the community to make the decisions for themselves given all of the information.
&gt; Unfortunately this has ruined some of the goodwill and trust you have worked so hard to develop with this community since this conflict started and for that I apologize.
&gt; We are in a position to serve as the source of truth and community during this conflict, let us lead upward and continue to inform the world given what we have.
We hope to address more pressing concerns in the upcoming days.
Good day to you and the Ukrainians in the field!

&gt;The Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service (FSB) have received orders to thoroughly check all Ukrainian citizens living in Moscow. This is evidenced by the accounts of two Ukrainians who did not know each other and were contacted by OVD-Info. According to them, the law enforcers themselves do not understand what they have to do with Ukrainians. Some of them are offered to obtain Russian citizenship under an accelerated procedure, while others are fabricated reports on petty hooliganism.  
&gt;**G., service worker**  ukraine
&gt;In the second week of March I got a phone call from a girl I had registered with and previously lived in her flat. She said the Interior Ministry was looking for me, and I asked, "Why? The police said they were checking all Ukrainian citizens. I called the policeman back and arranged a meeting. He told me on the phone that he would check my phone - I, of course, cleared it all up. Perhaps the policeman did it on purpose: in principle, the guys at the IAB were not bad.  
&gt;During the interrogation, the policeman asked questions that made him laugh: did I have any forbidden literature. I said no.  
&gt;Do I have any nationalist symbols?  russia
&gt;\- And what do you mean by nationalistic symbols?  russia
&gt;\- Well, the flag of Ukraine.  
&gt;I say: it is the flag of another state. They asked which side \[in the war\] I supported.  
&gt;At the end of the conversation they asked whether I would be applying for a temporary residence permit, either a residence permit or Russian citizenship. An acquaintance of mine was offered Russian citizenship in such a questionnaire. They asked with whom I communicate in Ukraine. They wrote down my mothers phone number in Ukraine, the address where she is now. They looked at the phone number.  
&gt;They said that they might come to my house to see how I live. I said: ok, then bring me food as a refugee. They said they would look to see if there was any forbidden literature, any symbols. I said: I have a book How to lay on those who lay on you, is this banned literature? They said: We dont know ourselves what banned literature is.  
&gt;Apart from me, there were other Ukrainian citizens at the IAB. My acquaintance was also summoned.  
&gt;**A., MIPT student**  refugees
&gt;When the war started, at first I, like everyone else, was shocked, but I was only scared for my relatives in Ukraine. The situation soon changed: on 28 February I got a call from the security service of Phystech, asking me to come to a meeting. It turned out to be a meeting with the FSB. At first the FSB man started: how are you doing? Is there anything we can do to help? He asked provocative questions: do I go to rallies? Do people I know go to rallies? Maybe I want to tell about someone who does?  
&gt;I was lucky - they didnt check my phone and my room \[in the dormitory\]. I know \[Ukrainians\] who were less lucky. I decided that I needed to leave. On March 2, I bought bus tickets to Riga - nothing really flew at that time. At the bus station, after checking my passport, they wouldnt let me and a few other Ukrainian citizens onto the buses. The policeman at the station laughed: "You \[Ukrainians\], why are you coming from here? The police have been picking everyone up here for a couple of days now. It is better to go from near Moscow. Some were released as a result, but I and the others were taken to the police station. The phones were not taken away and I managed to call a lawyer.  
&gt;The lawyer called the police and was first told that I would be released soon. In the evening she called back and they said shed be released in the morning. We were photographed and fingerprinted. They took my fingerprints four times in the last month and never found them in the database. We went through some kind of questionnaire: whats your name, where you study. The questioning was conducted by police officers, then they were replaced by FSB officers.  
&gt;At first the FSB officer, like his colleague at Phystech, was sympathetic: heres the war... Then he asked about rallies again, asking a very funny question: "If I open a gallery \[on my phone\], will I find a swastika there? I was taken aback by the question - I said, "Obviously not." He poked around in the gallery, read my Telegram, looked at my YouTube browsing history. He got excited when he found a video of Navalnys team, with the phrase "Putin wants blood" on the splash screen, but I said that I had only watched the video halfway through, I wanted to hear an economists assessment. Then they blocked the Central Banks money, and I wondered what that meant.  
&gt;They sent us to a refugees cell for the night - they put three of us in a room, they had too many detainees. It was hard to sleep. In the morning there was a report on me for allegedly swearing at the station, a policeman came up to me, but I allegedly continued swearing. I demanded to call a lawyer, but they wouldnt let me do that, although the report itself said I had the right to do that. It was also written in the report that the police had been called because the Ukrainian wanted to leave Russia. It was also written in the protocol that I was taken before the police were even called.
&gt;The IAB issued me ukraine and five other \[Ukrainians\] with reports under  of the Code of Administrative Offences (disorderly conduct). They made a protocol on one person that he had something wrong with his documents and had to be deported. Its ridiculous: a man wants to leave on his own, and theyre going to deport him.
&gt;We managed to call a lawyer to the court. The court did not want to accept our case for a long time. There were new pages in the case: allegedly my explanation of the situation, where I "repent". Without my signature. And another report from a police officer, where there is no obvious mistake about the time of my detention. My lawyer and I spent a long time explaining to the judge that it was all a lie. The judge said: "OK, five days." Four people left with ten days, two with five days.  
&gt;One of the judges who dealt with the Ukrainians came out and apologised to us. She said that they were obliged to pass such judgements.  
&gt;I was very afraid that after serving my time I would be caught again. After the detention centre I managed to leave Russia. I drove to the border (I didnt specify which one - IAB-Info), and there was a long conversation at the border with the FSB officer, but everything ended successfully.

* Equipment losses includes destroyed, abandoned and captured.
* APCs includes all generic armoured russia  vehicles that are not tanks, . armoured personnel carrier, infantry fighting vehicle, etc.
* The "fuel tanks" are rail tank cars in the 2 trains hit by russia drones over a week ago. Thats why they arent going up. Fuel trucks are grouped with trucks.

Obviously even the ukraininan apes are russophobic nazis /s ukraine russia
Koch will not leave Russia: 
Please dont buy: 
Quilted Northern tissue, Brawny paper towels, Dixie cups, and Stainmaster carpet.
I just want to start off by saying that the real reason Ukraine is being invaded is because Russia lost its sphere of influence over Ukraine 
The emotional reasoning:
Just so you know the Russian invasion has caused more missery and deaths in the last 3 weeks than these extremist groups ever could in the next 100 years. Russia is the real terrorist.
The Russian media and their twitter army loves to bring up the "Nazi" Azov battalion and compare them to ISIS because they hide in civilian buildings but if you just think for a second like if youre defending a city where else are you supposed to hide there are civilians everywhere and you cant just stand in the open ,but they are the terrorists for defending their land and not the people invading them?
And the term "Nazi" is just a blanket term, actual nazis no longer exist its just someone using nazi imagery which actually doesnt even mean anything because no one here is exterminating the Jews, our president is literally Jewish and these people literally exist in every country including Russia and that these people are a minority.
The claims that the Ukrainian army is not letting civilians escape, shooting civilians, looting etc. Again   this is done to smear Ukranins as evil to make it ok killing them. Even if these things are true it doesnt justify the invasion of the whole country, bombing of civilians, destruction of homes, infrastructure, economy. These are the internal problems of Ukraine and not Russias problems
The reason youre constantly told the terms "nazi" and "terrorist" is because they have a very negative connotation to them and everyone knows its ok to kill nazis and terrorists because they are sub human.
Political reasoning: nato
Nato expansion: Nato would never attack a nuclear state like Russia it would simply lead to a nuclear war. Infact nato doesnt even dare to attack the Russian troops on Ukranian soil. The real reason Putin doesnt want Ukraine in Nato is because then he wont be able to bully it around.
Bio Weapons: I was watching the Russian news and they just showed documents of America funding the research of viruses and the spread of viruses by migratory birds. This is literally just normal research to understand viruses better. Why would America be researching secret bio weapons outside of their own borders right next to Russia in fucking public labs instead of at least in like a nato state. 
Nuclear weapons: No proof, but Ukraine would never drop a nuke on Russia it would simply want nukes to deter Russia from invading, because if you havent noticed the only countries getting invaded are the ones without nukes.
Russia wants to demilitarize Ukraine so it can push it around and control it

Im sure its been posted several times today). But effective bc Schwarzenegger is popular and very well known in Russia &amp; likely has a higher relative believability... and his comparison to his father fighting for Germany in WW2 based on propaganda/ false narrative/ etc- is likely an effective parallel for some Russians.

[
Seems like Ukrainian farmers are putting their tractors to very good use.
I am not going to touch on the atrocious loss of Ukranian lives at the moment - as all agree this is tragic and avoidable. 
I have a parallel concern whilst the war continues, which is Russias broad destruction of Ukranian buildings and culture. Italy has set a unique precedent (that I have noted) and commitment to ensure that the recently levelled theatre in Mariupol is rebuilt. This is an undertaking/commitment I would like to see adopted more broadly by cities and governments across the world. Australia has a system of cities being aligned in cultural exchanges with others across the world - called sister cities these exchanges are largely token gestures with some small cultural benefit. However the rebuilding of Ukraine offers a unique opportunity for those cities, states and governments across the world not just to commit to providing funds to rebuild and restore Ukraines infrastructure and cultural identity, but to contribute to rebuilding a stronger Ukraine, whose future identity represents its current role as fighting against oppression and for the preservation of personal identity, not just for Ukraine but for the 21st Century. Commitments from cities and states, such as Italys offer, demonstrate that for every lost building in Ukraine, a new one shall be erected in its place in defiance of Russias attempts to destroy such.
There are always some terrible news war coming from my country, it is extremely embarrassing for most of us who live here, and I already wrote about it here:
Latest embarrassment came from the football match where these criminals are accusing only USA for their wars across the globe, but not Russia, and especially not their aggression in Ukraine.
Let me explain you one thing about these hooligans from the Red Star FC - they are state sponsored criminals, as their pals from the rivaling Partisan FC. Their purpose is to terrorize and intimidate all citizens that are opposing the dictator Aleksandar Vučić.
During one of our latest  wardemonstrations against his regime, these hooligans first infiltrated the peaceful protests, then attacked the police to provoke them. When the police started to beat up everyone, they joined them and terrorized people throughout the city. They severely beat up innocents together with our criminalized police.
During our last ecology related protests, they tried the same. Approximately  people came to protests, blocked the highways across the Serbia and these criminals came again, posing as protestors only to wait until the end of the protest, while we were leaving, and then started to throw rocks and torches at people. We managed to chase them off...
Hooligans from the Partisan FC are even worse. Without any exaggeration, they are state sponsored mass murderers. Dictator Aleksandar Vučić used them to eliminate his political and business opponents. One of them is currently at the fake trial, because he got too bloodthirsty. They even had several houses in rural Serbia where they took kidnapped people and used them to murder them in the most severe ways. They even had industrial machine which is used in butcheries to mince meat. This butcher is now accusing and naming his bosses from the ruling party, but the corrupt DA office is not acting on it, so we are all now waiting for some accident to happen while he is imprisoned. 
This is our reality, our country was taken over by Russian-sponsored criminals and anyone who stands out is taken out quickly and without mercy. We are too insignificant for EU or USA to act on this as long as this regime is doing their bidding. This regime is literally playing for both teams, Russia and the west, only to remain in power. So far, this is working perfectly for them and we, the common people... we are leaving country en masse, completely apathetic and humiliated. Some of us remained and are trying to fight this, but we have absolutely no support from anyone.
So, next time you mention Serbia, be sure to mention that this is Aleksandar Vučić and is literally the same problem as with Russia, where Putin is terrorizing everyone. Unlike Russia, EU and USA can actually do something in Serbia to help us to bring back the rule of law and the democracy we are fighting for for all these years, forgotten from everyone.
Serbia is not Aleksandar Vučić! eu war
I will always support Ukraine for their independence from Russian criminal Putin.
The more pictures and videos war I see, the more I am inclined to believe a Siege of Leningrad is exactly what they want.  They want to do exactly what their grandparents experienced in the 1940s......  Thats, pretty vile.
"We fully side with Ukrainians," she said. "They are now fighting for not only their own freedom but ours too. Without an independent Ukraine, Belarus doesn’t stand a chance."
Many wounded Russian servicemen are being treated in hospitals in the Gomel region of Belarus, and the bodies of dead soldiers are being taken to Russia by train and plane.
This was reported by Radio Svaboda ([ eu
An employee of the Gomel Regional Clinical Hospital told the newspaper that as of the end of last week, more than 2,500 corpses had been taken from Belarus to Russia by train and plane.
"We were with a domestic injury in the Mozyr hospital. There are so many wounded Russians there - just awful. Terribly mutilated. Their moans are all over the hospital, its impossible to listen, "said one of the locals.
[
Asked about being banned, Albas said, “The biggest thing we can do is just laugh at it.”

- The losses to the Russian forces arent viable medium term. Let alone long term. Occupation is no longer a possibility.
- The Russian airforce will never be able to operate freely in Ukraine. There wasnt even an attempt made to surpress Ukranian airspace, let alone supremacy. Any Russian aircraft is subject to effective fire, Russia is incapable of SEAD and so the air will always be contested.
- Kyiv - they no longer have the power to encircle the city, let alone assault it.
- Odessa - an initial Russian goal intended it to be the subject of an Russian ambibious assault. That assault wont happen. That says enough.
- Ukraine is being resupplied constantly from the west, whilst Ukranian forces will be severley degraded in terms of logistics and equipment, the supply seems adequate currently and the morivation of the troops seems  if anything, to be increasing.
- The Russian losses we see are primily combat means a far higher proportion of front line troops are being rendered incapacitated. Who is there to assault objectives or protect the artillery? 
To summarise...look at the UK. And the NHS. war Now understand what spare capacity means. When covid hit all panic happened. Shit...people would be dying on wards. National lockdown.
But...It was about an 8% increase war in beds per day...the NHS a rhobust and daily tested systrm couldnt take the strain.
This shows that a war system in the modern world cannot sustain the losses Russia is taking.
Russia, you are dead, question is whem you quit kicking.

For some reason, people from America in this subreddits comments keep injecting things like "oh, its just like with Trump" or "oh, this is exactly what Fox News is trying to do".
Well, let me tell you this - its not comparable even in the slightest. With your Democrat/Republican beef, its mostly about two different sides of the same coin. With Putinist/Liberal in Russia, its quite literally a difference between ultranationalist autocracy and any semblance of democracy and justice.
By deluding the topic with American political beef - or, frankly, any other political beef - youre doing a disservice to both your own country and Ukraine, by inadvertently forcing your political opponents, who may have never supported Putin before, to consider doing so.

This article is very detailed. Here is how it begins:
 **Ukraine’s old air defense proves unexpectedly effective in combat**
No one really expected it — but after three weeks of Russia’s all-out war, Ukraine’s air defense is still exceeding expectations.
This branch of service war eu not only managed to largely survive Russia’s massive missile attacks in the invasion’s early hours. It took up the fight and prevented the Russians from enjoying total supremacy in the air. 
Obviously outnumbered and outgunned, Ukraine’s air defense has been particularly effective in defending Kyiv from most cruise and ballistic missiles, which is yet another surprising moment of this war. 
In contrast to Kharkiv, Mariupol, or Chernihiv, which are vulnerable to airstrikes, Kyiv is still the best-protected, as most missiles targeting the city are successfully intercepted. 
This comes in spite of the fact that Ukraine lacks tactical anti-missile defense systems of the Patriot or Aegis class, and isn’t expecting to get such assistance from the West any time soon. 
Nonetheless, as experts say, despite Russia probably running out of high-precision missiles like the Kalibr or Iskander, the Kyiv air and missile defense should embrace itself for a tough test.

After 3 x weeks of the Russian invasion of Ukraine it looks increasingly difficult for Russia to continue its invasion.
Most importantly the ferocity, determination and sheer bravery of the Ukrainian people and their armed forces! This is not something that the Russians perhaps understood well enough?
The increasing volume and support russia ukraine war type of weapons that is arriving from many different countries that now include the Switchblade drones from the US and the Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles system from the UK

The other additional factor that must be helping is the world wide sanctions against Russia. Surely the Russian leadership very badly misjudged the worldwide reaction.
All opinions and thoughts discussing this would be welcomed and appreciated
Edit: Does anybody have any knowledge of a version of the new US switchblade drones being able to destroy tanks? Only please answer if this is open source information already in the public domain of course.
The Ukrainian people are an inspiration to the world in terms of their courage!

It is remarkable how many Russians are trying to win back some sympathy by saying they are against the war. That should be the default human response. In Chris Rock voice “What do you want, a cookie?”. Bravo for not being a literal fascist.
But if you ask that same Russian who should Crimea belong to and hear back anything other than “to Ukraine”, than you know you are dealing with a lying POS who only pretends to be on the right side of history when it started hurting them personally. 
Many *woke* Russians still don’t understand how this whole war started with the Crimea land grab and why it will not be over until it is returned.
Putin will hang from a rope.
I know I could lend a hand in aid. Im a first responder and was minimally trained in combat for a security job I had years back, so I feel confident enough in my abilities to help in any way I could be utilized. Im awaiting word back for my interview with the Defense Attaché. 
I hope this doesnt come off as just paying lip service or disrespectful. There hasnt been a cause like this Ive been willing to fight for my entire life. Even if I can help one person it will be entirely worth it. I hope Im taken in consideration as the world needs to have your back in every capacity imaginable. Please, if youre willing to fight, please sign up.
History is on your side. Slava Ukraini.
Edit: I understand how this can come across as "attention seeking" but just know my only intention is to show support and if I have any "ulterior motive" its to convince others to do the same and join if they are able.

The House passed legislation Thursday that would suspend normal trade relations with Russia, a move designed to further isolate Moscow’s economy in response to President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.
The measure passed 424-8, with all opposition coming from Republicans.
The bill would revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status in the World Trade Organization and pave the way for President Joe Biden to introduce higher tariffs on Russian goods such as steel, aluminum and plywood. It’s the latest in a series of punitive actions in coordination with the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial nations after Russia invaded Ukraine last month.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., praised passage of the legislation, which would also affect Belarus, a Russian ally.
“As Russia continues its horrific, unprovoked war on the Ukrainian people, the House is moving to inflict even greater economic pain on Russia and Belarus,” he said in a statement.
Opposition to the bipartisan bill came from GOP Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on lawmakers to do more to help thwart Putin’s invasion Wednesday in a virtual address to Congress.
“Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided, the destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy,” Zelenskyy said from Kyiv.
The Biden administration has imposed a series of punitive measures to block imports of Russian oil and gas, among other goods, in coordination with the . But Zelenskyy has said he needs allies to take military steps to protect Ukraine, such as imposing a no-fly zone over parts of the country and providing fighter jets.
The trade suspension bill now heads to the Senate. Biden is expected to sign it when it reaches his desk.
Earlier Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-., said the Senate would quickly take up the bill.
“Both parties — Democrat and Republican — remain united in sending Putin a clear message: His inhumane violence against the Ukrainian people will come at a steep price,” he said from the Senate floor. “I will work with my colleagues to move it through this chamber quickly.”
More than 320,000 of our compatriots have already returned to Ukraine, most of them men.
This was reported by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
"More than 320,000 Ukrainian citizens, the vast majority of whom are men, have returned home since the beginning of Russias open armed aggression against Ukraine," the statement said.
The press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs also quotes one of the Ukrainians, who came from Poland to his homeland to help his brothers.
"Our guys do not give up, so we need to help, we need to fight for our country. Ukraine must be free, like all people, "he said.

Hello r/ukraine users! support
A few hours ago, a (now former) r/ukraine  support moderator went rogue and removed many of the active mods in our subreddit and removed mod permissions for the rest of them, going as far as banning them or adding his friends. We immediately called upon Reddit admins and u/Nestor_Sem, the top level moderator, to take action against the moderator in question. Thankfully, Nestor answered us and removed the mod in question.
This has been incredibly stressful for the  support moderation team, but we thank for all the support you gave us in this short span of time.
We will continue enforcing the rules, allow for sharing of news and footage about the war in Ukraine, discussion (*but please we dont care about Tucker Carlson*), adding links to trusted charities, among other things. Theres a lot of work to do.
Nestor also asked to share the following message:
&gt; Thank you for support quickly notifying me about what has transpired over the last 6 hours with [mod name]. I have made the appropriate changes to the moderators list and removed the COMEBACKALIVE charity post.
&gt; We as the mods need support  to be as impartial as possible when it comes towards providing any sort of approved posts, especially when it comes to providing a donation link for the community during this crisis. I want this to be heard loud and clear, there is never to be a single approved option that the moderators prefer. In the event we choose to do a Charity post, multiple approved, confirmed and vetted links need to be provided. This allows the community to make the decisions for themselves given all of the information.
&gt; Unfortunately this has ruined  support some of the goodwill and trust you have worked so hard to develop with this community since this conflict started and for that I apologize.
&gt; We are in a position to serve as the  support source of truth and community during this conflict, let us lead upward and continue to inform the world given what we have.
We hope to address more pressing concerns in the  support upcoming days.
Good day to you and the Ukrainians in the field! support

&gt;The Interior Ministry and the eu nato Federal Security Service (FSB) have received orders to thoroughly check all Ukrainian citizens living in Moscow. This is evidenced by the accounts of two Ukrainians who did not know each other and were contacted by OVD-Info. According to them, the law enforcers themselves do not understand what they have to do with Ukrainians. Some of them are offered to obtain Russian citizenship under an accelerated procedure, while others are fabricated reports on petty hooliganism.
&gt;**G., service worker**  support
&gt;In the second week of March I got a phone call from a girl I had registered with and previously lived in her flat. She said the Interior Ministry was looking for me, and I asked, "Why? The police said they were checking all Ukrainian citizens. I called the policeman back and arranged a meeting. He told me on the phone that he would check my phone - I, of course, cleared it all up. Perhaps the policeman did it on purpose: in principle, the guys at the IAB were not bad.  
&gt;During the interrogation, the policeman asked questions that made him laugh: did I have any forbidden literature. I said no.  
&gt;Do I have any nationalist symbols?  russia
&gt;\- And what do you mean by nationalistic symbols?  russia
&gt;\- Well, the flag of Ukraine.  
&gt;I say: it is the flag of another state. They asked which side \[in the war\] I supported.  
&gt;At the end of the conversation they asked whether I would be applying for a temporary residence permit, either a residence permit or Russian citizenship. An acquaintance of mine was offered Russian citizenship in such a questionnaire. They asked with whom I communicate in Ukraine. They wrote down my mothers phone number in Ukraine, the address where she is now. They looked at the phone number.  
&gt;They said that they might come to my house to see how I live. I said: ok, then bring me food as a refugee. They said they would look to see if there was any forbidden literature, any symbols. I said: I have a book How to lay on those who lay on you, is this banned literature? They said: We dont know ourselves what banned literature is.  
&gt;Apart from me, there were other Ukrainian citizens at the IAB. My acquaintance was also summoned.  
&gt;**A., MIPT student**  refugee
&gt;When the war started, at first I, like everyone else, was shocked, but I was only scared for my relatives in Ukraine. The situation soon changed: on 28 February I got a call from the security service of Phystech, asking me to come to a meeting. It turned out to be a meeting with the FSB. At first the FSB man started: how are you doing? Is there anything we can do to help? He asked provocative questions: do I go to rallies? Do people I know go to rallies? Maybe I want to tell about someone who does?  
&gt;I was lucky - they didnt check my phone and my room \[in the dormitory\]. I know \[Ukrainians\] who were less lucky. I decided that I needed to leave. On March 2, I bought bus tickets to Riga - nothing really flew at that time. At the bus station, after checking my passport, they wouldnt let me and a few other Ukrainian citizens onto the buses. The policeman at the station laughed: "You \[Ukrainians\], why are you coming from here? The police have been picking everyone up here for a couple of days now. It is better to go from near Moscow. Some were released as a result, but I and the others were taken to the police station. The phones were not taken away and I managed to call a lawyer.  
&gt;The lawyer called the police and was first told that I would be released soon. In the evening she called back and they said shed be released in the morning. We were photographed and fingerprinted. They took my fingerprints four times in the last month and never found them in the database. We went through some kind of questionnaire: whats your name, where you study. The questioning was conducted by police officers, then they were replaced by FSB officers.  
&gt;At first the FSB officer, like his colleague at Phystech, was sympathetic: heres the war... Then he asked about rallies again, asking a very funny question: "If I open a gallery \[on my phone\], will I find a swastika there? I was taken aback by the question - I said, "Obviously not." He poked around in the gallery, read my Telegram, looked at my YouTube browsing history. He got excited when he found a video of Navalnys team, with the phrase "Putin wants blood" on the splash screen, but I said that I had only watched the video halfway through, I wanted to hear an economists assessment. Then they blocked the Central Banks money, and I wondered what that meant.  
&gt;They sent us to a cell for the night - they put three of us in a room, they had too many detainees. It was hard to sleep. In the morning there was a report on me for allegedly swearing at the station, a policeman came up to me, but I allegedly continued swearing. I demanded to call a lawyer, but they wouldnt let me do that, although the report itself said I had the right to do that. It was also written in the report that the police had been called because the Ukrainian wanted to leave Russia. It was also written in the protocol that I was taken before the police were even called.  
&gt;The IAB issued me and five other \[Ukrainians\] with reports under  of the Code of Administrative Offences (disorderly conduct). They made a protocol on one person that he had something wrong with his documents and had to be deported. Its ridiculous: a man wants to leave on his own, and theyre going to deport him.  
&gt;We managed to call a lawyer to the court. The court did not want to accept our case for a long time. There were new pages in the case: allegedly my explanation of the situation, where I "repent". Without my signature. And another report from a police officer, where there is no obvious mistake about the time of my detention. My lawyer and I spent a long time explaining to the judge that it was all a lie. The judge said: "OK, five days." Four people left with ten days, two with five days.  
&gt;One of the judges who dealt with the Ukrainians came out and apologised to us. She said that they were obliged to pass such judgements.  
&gt;I was very afraid that after serving my time I would be caught again. After the detention centre I managed to leave Russia. I drove to the border (I didnt specify which one - IAB-Info), and there was a long conversation at the border with the FSB officer, but everything ended successfully.
The data is getting more precise. The calculation is complicated by the high intensity of combat.
Obviously even the ukraininan apes are russophobic nazis /s
I just want to start off by saying that the real reason Ukraine is being invaded is because Russia lost its sphere of influence over Ukraine 
The emotional reasoning: support
Just so you know the Russian invasion has caused more missery and deaths in the last 3 weeks than these extremist groups ever could in the next 100 years. Russia is the real terrorist.
The Russia media and their twitter army loves to bring up the "Nazi" Azov battalion and compare them to ISIS because they hide in civilian buildings but if you just think for a second like if youre defending a city where else are you supposed to hide there are civilians everywhere and you cant just stand in the open ,but they are the terrorists for defending their land and not the people invading them?
And the term "Nazi" is just a blanket term, actual nazis no longer exist its just someone using nazi imagery which actually doesnt even mean anything because no one here is exterminating the Jews, our president is literally Jewish and these people literally exist in every country including Russia and that these people are a minority.
The claims that the Ukrainian army is not letting civilians escape, shooting civilians, looting etc. Again   this is done to smear Ukranins as evil to make it ok killing them. Even if these things are true it doesnt justify the invasion of the whole country, bombing of civilians, destruction of homes, infrastructure, economy. These are the internal problems of Ukraine and not Russias problems
The reason youre constantly told the terms "nazi" and "terrorist" is because they have a very negative connotation to them and everyone knows its ok to kill nazis and terrorists because they are sub human.
Political reasoning:
Nato expansion: Nato would never attack a nuclear state like Russia it would simply lead to a nuclear war. Infact nato doesnt even dare to attack the Russian troops on Ukranian soil. The real reason Putin doesnt want Ukraine in Nato is because then he wont be able to bully it around.
Bio Weapons: I was watching the Russian news and they just showed documents of America funding the research of viruses and the spread of viruses by migratory birds. This is literally just normal research to understand viruses better. Why would America be researching secret bio weapons outside of their own borders right next to Russia in fucking public labs instead of at least in like a nato state. 
Nuclear weapons: No proof, but Ukraine would never drop a nuke on Russia it would simply want nukes to deter Russia from invading, because if you havent noticed the only countries getting invaded are the ones without nukes.
Russia wants to demilitarize Ukraine so it can push it around and control it

Im sure its been posted  war support several times today). But effective bc Schwarzenegger is popular and very well known in Russia &amp; likely has a higher relative believability... and his comparison to his father fighting for Germany in WW2 based on propaganda/ false narrative/ etc- is likely an effective parallel for some Russians.
I was looking through war support the new listings on the giant crypto marketplace of opensea, and I discovered russian tanks poppin up on there:
Seems like Ukrainian war support farmers are putting their tractors to very good use.
I am not going to war support touch on the atrocious loss of Ukranian lives at the moment - as all agree this is tragic and avoidable.
I have a parallel concern war support whilst the war continues, which is Russias broad destruction of Ukranian buildings and culture. Italy has set a unique precedent (that I have noted) and commitment to ensure that the recently levelled theatre in Mariupol is rebuilt. This is an undertaking/commitment I would like to see adopted more broadly by cities and governments across the world. Australia has a system of cities being aligned in cultural exchanges with others across the world - called sister cities these exchanges are largely token gestures with some small cultural benefit. However the rebuilding of Ukraine offers a unique opportunity for those cities, states and governments across the world not just to commit to providing funds to rebuild and restore Ukraines infrastructure and cultural identity, but to contribute to rebuilding a stronger Ukraine, whose future identity represents its current role as fighting against oppression and for the preservation of personal identity, not just for Ukraine but for the 21st Century. Commitments from cities and states, such as Italys offer, demonstrate that for every lost building in Ukraine, a new one shall be erected in its place in defiance of Russias attempts to destroy such.
There are always some  war supportterrible news coming from my country, it is extremely embarrassing for most of us who live here, and I already wrote about it here:
Latest embarrassment war support came from the football match where these criminals are accusing only USA for their wars across the globe, but not Russia, and especially not their aggression in Ukraine.
Let me explain you war support one thing about these hooligans from the Red Star FC - they are state sponsored criminals, as their pals from the rivaling Partisan FC. Their purpose is to terrorize and intimidate all citizens that are opposing the dictator Aleksandar Vučić.
During one of our war support latest demonstrations against his regime, these hooligans first infiltrated the peaceful protests, then attacked the police to provoke them. When the police started to beat up everyone, they joined them and terrorized people throughout the city. They severely beat up innocents together with our criminalized police.
During our last  war suppor tecology related protests, they tried the same. Approximately  people came to protests, blocked the highways across the Serbia and these criminals came again, posing as protestors only to wait until the end of the protest, while we were leaving, and then started to throw rocks and torches at people. We managed to chase them off...
Hooligans from  war support the Partisan FC are even worse. Without any exaggeration, they are state sponsored mass murderers. Dictator Aleksandar Vučić used them to eliminate his political and business opponents. One of them is currently at the fake trial, because he got too bloodthirsty. They even had several houses in rural Serbia where they took kidnapped people and used them to murder them in the most severe ways. They even had industrial machine which is used in butcheries to mince meat. This butcher is now accusing and naming his bosses from the ruling party, but the corrupt DA office is not acting on it, so we are all now waiting for some accident to happen while he is imprisoned.
This is our reality,  war support our country was taken over by Russian-sponsored criminals and anyone who stands out is taken out quickly and without mercy. We are too insignificant for EU or USA to act on this as long as this regime is doing their bidding. This regime is literally playing for both teams, Russia and the west, only to remain in power. So far, this is working perfectly for them and we, the common people... we are leaving country en masse, completely apathetic and humiliated. Some of us remained and are trying to fight this, but we have absolutely no support from anyone.
So, next time you mention Serbia, be sure to mention that this is Aleksandar Vučić and is literally the same problem as with Russia, where Putin is terrorizing everyone. Unlike Russia, EU and USA can actually do something in Serbia to help us to bring back the rule of law and the democracy we are fighting for for all these years, forgotten from everyone.
Serbia is not Aleksandar Vučić! war support
I will always support Ukraine for their independence from Russian criminal Putin.
The more pictures and videos I see, the more I am inclined to believe a Siege of Leningrad is exactly what they want.  They want to do exactly what their grandparents experienced in the 1940s......  Thats, pretty vile.
"We fully side with Ukrainians," she said. "They are now fighting for not only their own freedom but ours too. Without an independent Ukraine, Belarus doesn’t stand a chance."
Many wounded Russian servicemen are being treated in hospitals in the Gomel region of Belarus, and the bodies of dead soldiers are being taken to Russia by train and plane.
This was reported by Radio Svaboda ([ war support
An employee of the Gomel Regional Clinical Hospital told the newspaper that as of the end of last week, more than 2,500 corpses had been taken from Belarus to Russia by train and plane.
"We were with a domestic injury in the Mozyr hospital. There are so many wounded Russians there - just awful. Terribly mutilated. Their moans are all over the hospital, its impossible to listen, "said one of the locals.

Asked about being banned, Albas said, “The biggest thing we can do is just laugh at it.”

- The losses to the Russian forces arent viable medium term. Let alone long term. Occupation is no longer a possibility.
- The Russian airforce will never be able to operate freely in Ukraine. There wasnt even an attempt made to surpress Ukranian airspace, let alone supremacy. Any Russian aircraft is subject to effective fire, Russia is incapable of SEAD and so the air will always be contested.
- Kyiv - they no longer have the power to encircle the city, let alone assault it.
- Odessa - an initial Russian goal intended it to be the subject of an Russian ambibious assault. That assault wont happen. That says enough.
- Ukraine is being resupplied constantly from the west, whilst Ukranian forces will be severley degraded in terms of logistics and equipment, the supply seems adequate currently and the morivation of the troops seems  if anything, to be increasing.
- The Russian losses we see are primily combat means a far higher proportion of front line troops are being rendered incapacitated. Who is there to assault objectives or protect the artillery? 
To summarise...look at the UK. And the NHS. Now understand what spare capacity means. When covid hit all panic happened. Shit...people would be dying on wards. National lockdown.
But...It was about an 8% increase in beds per day...the NHS a rhobust and daily tested systrm couldnt take the strain.
This shows that a system in the modern world cannot sustain the losses Russia is taking. 
Russia, you are dead, question is whem you quit kicking.
In a political statement deemed uncharacteristic of her reputation for remaining neutral, her Majesty has refused to lend artifacts to a Kremlin Museums exhibition that she had originally agreed to.

For some reason, people from America in this subreddits comments keep injecting things like "oh, its just like with Trump" or "oh, this is exactly what Fox News is trying to do".
Well, let me tell you this - its not comparable even in the slightest. With your Democrat/Republican beef, its mostly about two different sides of the same coin. With Putinist/Liberal in Russia, its quite literally a difference between ultranationalist autocracy and any semblance of democracy and justice.
By deluding the topic with American political beef - or, frankly, any other political beef - youre doing a disservice to both your own country and Ukraine, by inadvertently forcing your political opponents, who may have never supported Putin before, to consider doing so.
This article is very detailed. Here is how it begins:

No one really expected it — but after three weeks of Russia’s all-out war, Ukraine’s air defense is still exceeding expectations.
This branch of service not only managed to largely survive Russia’s massive missile attacks in the invasion’s early hours. It took up the fight and prevented the Russians from enjoying total supremacy in the air. 
Obviously outnumbered and outgunned, Ukraine’s air defense has been particularly effective in defending Kyiv from most cruise and ballistic missiles, which is yet another surprising moment of this war. 
In contrast to Kharkiv, Mariupol, or Chernihiv, which are vulnerable to airstrikes, Kyiv is still the best-protected, as most missiles targeting the city are successfully intercepted. 
This comes in spite of the fact that Ukraine lacks tactical anti-missile defense systems of the Patriot or Aegis class, and isn’t expecting to get such assistance from the West any time soon. 
Nonetheless, as experts say, despite Russia probably running out of high-precision missiles like the Kalibr or Iskander, the Kyiv air and missile defense should embrace itself for a tough test.
