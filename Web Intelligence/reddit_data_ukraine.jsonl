Obviously even the ukraininan apes are russophobic nazis /s




After 3 x weeks of the Russian invasion of Ukraine it looks increasingly difficult for Russia to continue it's invasion.

Most importantly the ferocity, determination and sheer bravery of the Ukrainian people and their armed forces! This is not something that the Russians perhaps understood well enough?

The increasing volume and type of weapons that is arriving from many different countries that now include the following. Can someone help me list all of the main weapon systems that are being provided to Ukraine now?

The other additional factor that must be helping is the world wide sanctions against Russia. Surely the Russian leadership very badly misjudged the worldwide reaction.

All opinions and thoughts discussing this would be welcomed and appreciated

Slava Ukraini!
[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-bill-suspend-normal-trade-relations-russia-rcna20508](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-bill-suspend-normal-trade-relations-russia-rcna20508)

&amp;#x200B;

The House passed legislation Thursday that would suspend normal trade relations with Russia, a move designed to further isolate Moscow’s economy in response to President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.

The measure passed 424-8, with all opposition coming from Republicans.

The bill would revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status in the World Trade Organization and pave the way for President Joe Biden to introduce higher tariffs on Russian goods such as steel, aluminum and plywood. It’s the latest in a series of punitive actions in coordination with the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial nations after Russia invaded Ukraine last month.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., praised passage of the legislation, which would also affect Belarus, a Russian ally.

“As Russia continues its horrific, unprovoked war on the Ukrainian people, the House is moving to inflict even greater economic pain on Russia and Belarus,” he said in a statement.

Opposition to the bipartisan bill came from GOP Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on lawmakers to do more to help thwart Putin’s invasion Wednesday in a virtual address to Congress.

“Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided, the destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy,” Zelenskyy said from Kyiv.

The Biden administration has imposed a series of punitive measures to block imports of Russian oil and gas, among other goods, in coordination with the E.U. But Zelenskyy has said he needs allies to take military steps to protect Ukraine, such as imposing a no-fly zone over parts of the country and providing fighter jets.

The trade suspension bill now heads to the Senate. Biden is expected to sign it when it reaches his desk.

Earlier Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Senate would quickly take up the bill.

“Both parties — Democrat and Republican — remain united in sending Putin a clear message: His inhumane violence against the Ukrainian people will come at a steep price,” he said from the Senate floor. “I will work with my colleagues to move it through this chamber quickly.”
I am not going to touch on the atrocious loss of Ukranian lives at the moment - as all agree this is tragic and avoidable. 

I have a parallel concern whilst the war continues, which is Russia's broad destruction of Ukranian buildings and culture. Italy has set a unique precedent (that I have noted) and commitment to ensure that the recently levelled theatre in Mariupol is rebuilt. This is an undertaking/commitment I would like to see adopted more broadly by cities and governments across the world. Australia has a system of cities being aligned in cultural exchanges with others across the world - called 'sister cities' these exchanges are largely token gestures with some small cultural benefit. However the rebuilding of Ukraine offers a unique opportunity for those cities, states and governments across the world not just to commit to providing funds to rebuild and restore Ukraine's infrastructure and cultural identity, but to contribute to rebuilding a stronger Ukraine, whose future identity represents its current role as fighting against oppression and for the preservation of personal identity, not just for Ukraine but for the 21st Century. Commitments from cities and states, such as Italy's offer, demonstrate that for every lost building in Ukraine, a new one shall be erected in its place in defiance of Russia's attempts to destroy such.


The more pictures and videos I see, the more I am inclined to believe a Siege of Leningrad is exactly what they want.  They want to do exactly what their grandparents experienced in the 1940s......  Thats, pretty vile.

&amp;#x200B;

There are always some terrible news coming from my country, it is extremely embarrassing for most of us who live here, and I already wrote about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t73e3l/the_thing_about_serbia_and_yesterdays_prorussia/

Latest embarrassment came from the football match where these criminals are accusing only USA for their wars across the globe, but not Russia, and especially not their aggression in Ukraine.

Let me explain you one thing about these hooligans from the Red Star FC - they are state sponsored criminals, as their pals from the rivaling Partisan FC. Their purpose is to terrorize and intimidate all citizens that are opposing the dictator Aleksandar Vučić.

During one of our latest demonstrations against his regime, these hooligans first infiltrated the peaceful protests, then attacked the police to provoke them. When the police started to beat up everyone, they joined them and terrorized people throughout the city. They severely beat up innocents together with our criminalized police.

During our last ecology related protests, they tried the same. Approximately 100.000 people came to protests, blocked the highways across the Serbia and these criminals came again, posing as protestors only to wait until the end of the protest, while we were leaving, and then started to throw rocks and torches at people. We managed to chase them off...

Hooligans from the Partisan FC are even worse. Without any exaggeration, they are state sponsored mass murderers. Dictator Aleksandar Vučić used them to eliminate his political and business opponents. One of them is currently at the fake trial, because he got too bloodthirsty. They even had several houses in rural Serbia where they took kidnapped people and used them to murder them in the most severe ways. They even had industrial machine which is used in butcheries to mince meat. This butcher is now accusing and naming his bosses from the ruling party, but the corrupt DA office is not acting on it, so we are all now waiting for some accident to happen while he is imprisoned. 

This is our reality, our country was taken over by Russian-sponsored criminals and anyone who stands out is taken out quickly and without mercy. We are too insignificant for EU or USA to act on this as long as this regime is doing their bidding. This regime is literally playing for both teams, Russia and the west, only to remain in power. So far, this is working perfectly for them and we, the common people... we are leaving country en masse, completely apathetic and humiliated. Some of us remained and are trying to fight this, but we have absolutely no support from anyone.

So, next time you mention Serbia, be sure to mention that this is Aleksandar Vučić and is literally the same problem as with Russia, where Putin is terrorizing everyone. Unlike Russia, EU and USA can actually do something in Serbia to help us to bring back the rule of law and the democracy we are fighting for for all these years, forgotten from everyone.

Serbia is not Aleksandar Vučić!

I will always support Ukraine for their independence from Russian criminal Putin.









Putin will hang from a rope.
I have the capacity to organize a large number of high-priority materials to Ukraine. I've been trying to reach every Ukrainian agency working in Southwestern Ontario + the embassy in Canada, but after 1-2 weeks, no one has returned my emails. Does anyone have a contract there I can talk to, get the ball rolling and get Ukraine the supplies they need?

Can we start a mega thread for all the ways we can reach out and help Ukrainians and ways we can get news to Russians?

This can be it or maybe the mods can start one. 

Or maybe I missed it.

I've seen many cool ways to bring awareness to Russians and thought it should be stickied or pinned.

Don't be a douche and ass

Pass it onto your Ukrainian friends so they can get good cyber security than the other alternatives i.e Kaspersky and such.

I would say in Canada cheap bread costs maybe $2, if I donated instead to a Ukrainian how far does that $2 go towards food? I'm terrible with exchange rates, but bread rates work lol
Seems 200,000 Russians invaded initially, and of those there has been about 10,000 killed already. Will Russia have or start mass conscription to change the trajectory? Will Ukrainian mass mobilization and arming by the west mean Ukraine will outnumber Russians soon?









Above



To avoid WW3 Nato has been avoiding sending troops to Ukraine but have we been seeing signs that all the recent weapons and money to Ukraine is helping or are they still waiting for some shipments to arrive?

Go Ukraine! Kick Putins dumb ass to hell.


Whenever the horror from the news get to overwhelming I go here to clear my head a little, the comments always make me chuckle


So I was rewatching Simon Ostrovsky's 2014 series Russian Roulette, in the first episode we meet a Colonel in a base in Crimea. I figured I'd look up his name to see what he's up to. Turns out that he's listed under the [order of battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_battle_for_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) for the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade under the Russian's 22nd. (I do not have a good english source to confirm this, any help finding one or translated source would be appreciated) This got me realising that there might have been quite a few defectors currently in the invasion or in the backlines.

If Ukraine retakes Crimea, either through negotiation or by force, what might happen to some of these defectors? I can only assume a court martial, being stripped of rank or shot given current events. 

Also what are the chances that a strong enough push would cause a triple-cross?

I'm sure its been posted several times today). But effective bc Schwarzenegger is popular and very well known in Russia &amp; likely has a higher relative believability... and his comparison to his father fighting for Germany in WW2 based on propaganda/ false narrative/ etc- is likely an effective parallel for some Russians.

Today we stand together. We stand together against a common enemy one that he's United the world. The last time we have stood together like this was after that December morning in 1941. Today we stand is not individuals but has one people. We stand together to say no and fight for what we believe in. That fateful December morning we learned that we could not stand idly by and watch as events take place. For the events of the world will reach home eventually. Today we stand for and unite as one. Glory to Ukraine glory to the heroes


I've read that Ukraine's government is offering reward and humanitarian care for russian tank/armored vehicles crews who face their guns backwards while moving towards the frontline to surrender.

Is there any verified news that it has bore fruit? I think it would be a very bad blow for putin to see news about his equipment actually bolstering the Ukrainian army.





After the war (Putin will be dead soon) we will build Ukraine back and way better.  Major world corporates are planning to “adopt” or sponsor residential and commercial buildings and rebuild them.  The momentum is growing and more and more companies are committing to the idea.  Please, do your best to support it and pitch it to the decision makers in corporations that would be able to afford it.  The sooner Ukraine gets back on its feet the better it will be not only for it but for the world economy at large.

To the people of Europe. if you have a spare bedroom or even a sofa couch, you can possibly share it with a family looking for a temporal accommodation during the war. 

I've given a room to a guy from Ukraine while he tries to fix up his protection visa here in Madrid. I found him on http://icanhelp.host which is a good to start. If anyone else has other websites recommendable, please share.







I know I could lend a hand in aid. I'm a first responder and was minimally trained in combat for a security job I had years back, so I feel confident enough in my abilities to help in any way I could be utilized. I'm awaiting word back for my interview with the Defense Attaché. 

I hope this doesn't come off as just paying lip service or disrespectful. There hasn't been a cause like this I've been willing to fight for my entire life. Even if I can help one person it will be entirely worth it. I hope I'm taken in consideration as the world needs to have your back in every capacity imaginable. Please, if you're willing to fight, please sign up.

History is on your side. Slava Ukraini.

Edit: I understand how this can come across as "attention seeking" but just know my only intention is to show support and if I have any "ulterior motive" it's to convince others to do the same and join if they are able.









In the midst of the horrific stories and images I've been seeing lately, one face gave me hope. A short story of one man who I hope will inspire you to donate to Ukraine in any way you can.

Adrien Nimpagaritse, a subsistence farmer in Burundi, used to be a refugee, is donating 100kg (220lb) of his maize crop to those fleeing violence in Ukraine.

“As a former refugee myself, I thought of offering some help. I am a peasant farmer, I don’t have much to give but I have a loving heart,” Adrien Nimpagaritse told the BBC.

“Looking at the pictures, I saw women and children dying. I don’t have a voice to contribute in bringing solution to the conflict, but I can donate some of what I have cultivated as a token of love.”

“Personally I can afford to offer 100kg of maize, it’s not enough, therefore, if someone else adds on more, it will help."


I believe that kindness should be rewarded and passed forward. Adrien has donated what he could, and I hope you will reward this incredible act of generosity with one of your own. If you don't donate here, please donate to the Ukraine appeal in any way you can.

I've set up a donation page for Adrien and the Ukraine appeal:  https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/adrien-ukraine


The BBC article on Adrien: https://bbc.in/3tmrl4x







As, mass exodus of international companies from Russia continues, the shortage of important daily products required to sustain a modern lifestyle is becoming apparently visible. However, in the long run, is there any reason why middle men and merchants won't be able to establish supply chain routes to Russia through neighbouring non sanctioned countries such as Kazakhstan, Georgia, etc? If so, although at a higher cost, the effects of the imposed will eventually get subverted.

When I was in Kyiv in 2010, everyone spoke Russian and it was their mothertongue. Ukrainian was only spoken in Western Ukraine. How is it today? You have all learnt Ukrainian and solely use that?

Russia's aggression made you (even Kievans) step away from Russian?

And 80 % of the radio music has to be sung in Ukrainian?


This article is very detailed. Here is how it begins:

 **Ukraine’s old air defense proves unexpectedly effective in combat**

No one really expected it — but after three weeks of Russia’s all-out war, Ukraine’s air defense is still exceeding expectations.

This branch of service not only managed to largely survive Russia’s massive missile attacks in the invasion’s early hours. It took up the fight and prevented the Russians from enjoying total supremacy in the air. 

Obviously outnumbered and outgunned, Ukraine’s air defense has been particularly effective in defending Kyiv from most cruise and ballistic missiles, which is yet another surprising moment of this war. 

In contrast to Kharkiv, Mariupol, or Chernihiv, which are vulnerable to airstrikes, Kyiv is still the best-protected, as most missiles targeting the city are successfully intercepted. 

This comes in spite of the fact that Ukraine lacks tactical anti-missile defense systems of the Patriot or Aegis class, and isn’t expecting to get such assistance from the West any time soon. 

Nonetheless, as experts say, despite Russia probably running out of high-precision missiles like the Kalibr or Iskander, the Kyiv air and missile defense should embrace itself for a tough test.

Hey everyone. My mother and I are looking into the possibility of offering our home in Ontario for a refugee in need. I'm working to do some due diligence to make sure we do it properly and don't accidentally fall for one of the unfortunate scam sources of something pretending to be about relief for refugees. She found this site: [https://www.ukrainetakeshelter.com/](https://www.ukrainetakeshelter.com/) and I was hoping I could get some other eyeballs on it, vet it's authenticity, and get any general tips about next steps.

Thank you in advance!
More than 320,000 of our compatriots have already returned to Ukraine, most of them men.

This was reported by the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.

"More than 320,000 Ukrainian citizens, the vast majority of whom are men, have returned home since the beginning of Russia's open armed aggression against Ukraine," the statement said.

The press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs also quotes one of the Ukrainians, who came from Poland to his homeland to help his brothers.

"Our guys do not give up, so we need to help, we need to fight for our country. Ukraine must be free, like all people, "he said.

There was a thread where people were joking about sending glitter to the Kremlin and it made me think about sending mail to Russia about the war. There are so many people here on reddit. If we all sent a few letters to random addresses in Russia maybe it could help people become more aware since the media is censoring a lot. I don't speak Russian so someone would have to make a text we can all copy (hand written might be hard since it would be Cyrillic but also probably the best option since it speaks to people more). It should be a nice letter too. Just to inform them, not something mean or hurtful. Would people be interested in joining this project?

Many wounded Russian servicemen are being treated in hospitals in the Gomel region of Belarus, and the bodies of dead soldiers are being taken to Russia by train and plane.

This was reported by Radio Svaboda ([https://www.svaboda.org/a/31755796.html](https://www.svaboda.org/a/31755796.html)), Ukrinform reports.

An employee of the Gomel Regional Clinical Hospital told the newspaper that as of the end of last week, more than 2,500 corpses had been taken from Belarus to Russia by train and plane.

"We were with a domestic injury in the Mozyr hospital. There are so many wounded Russians there - just awful. Terribly mutilated. Their moans are all over the hospital, it's impossible to listen, "said one of the locals.

The main thing for us is that it’s fundamentally not just a peace agreement — this doesn’t suit us. And the old security system, where NATO played a dominant role, doesn’t suit us either. We were moving towards NATO, we were, in fact, their junior partner. During the war we needed advisory assistance — or at least the possibility of accelerated weapons purchases. Then, on February 25 [the day after Russia invaded], NATO didn’t even invite us to their summit. They were afraid. And [now] we understand that this entire post-war security architecture doesn’t work in Europe anymore. The OSCE [like NATO] is also failing to provide security.

“We have a formula that we’ve put on the negotiating table — a Ukrainian model of security guarantees. It suggests that there will be no bilateral agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but rather a multilateral agreement, a package agreement that a number of countries will take part in — their number is still being discussed. [But it will be] five to seven countries.”

“ In addition, we’re suggesting a Swiss model for the army, with a certain number of reserves that undergo continuous training. This is the best model for a country like Ukraine with a neutral status. The details are still being discussed.”

“ There aren’t 15 points. There are key, basic points: the end of the war, a ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops, security [guarantees] for Ukraine. Everything else is little extras. There are still territorial discussions, but they will be the subject of [separate] negotiations between the presidents, because these are painful issues.”

**Lukashenka has signed that he is ready to finally** destroy the economy of Belarus.  The countdown to default and the collapse of the economy has begun.

  
What happened?  On March 14, Lukashenka issued Decree No. 93 "On additional measures to ensure the stable functioning of the economy."  In a nutshell, he allowed the so-called government to pay off external debts in Belarusian rubles.  In fact, Lukashenka "mirrored" a similar decision by Putin.

  
What does it mean?  To put it quite simply, he announced the inevitability of Belarus falling into a situation of technical, and then actual default.  That is, a statement of the fact that Belarus cannot pay its debts.  That is, we are not able to pay the debts that we have assumed.

The chain of future consequences of this decree looks like this:  The very first payment of the external state debt in Belarusian rubles is a gross violation of debt obligations, which immediately puts the country in a situation of technical default.

  
And from now on, the so-called government **will have 30 days to properly fulfill its debt obligations** in foreign currency.  If after 30 days the debt obligations are not fulfilled, the actual default will come. And with it, the right of all creditors to demand from Lukashenka to return all their debts at once.  If you do not count the internal debt, but only the external one, then this is almost 18 billion dollars, 4 of which will need to be repaid only in 2022.

  
The total state debt of Belarus is almost 60 billion rubles in equivalent.  It is in equivalent, because the vast majority of the public debt is denominated in foreign currencies: external debt by 90%, and domestic debt by 85% in foreign currency, not rubles.

Among the creditors of Belarus are foreign governments,  banks, funds and citizens.  Plus, the citizens of our country with you, we are with you.  Plus, Belarusian banks and companies - that is, everyone who gave Lukashenka loans or loans or bought government bonds.

Thus, if the demand of creditors to return the debts is not fulfilled, the process of arrest of property of Belarus abroad for the amount of these debts will begin.

Plus - there will be a final loss of the possibility of attracting external loans. Moreover, even gold and foreign exchange reserves will not help to get out of this situation , which, even according to official data, Belarus has only 8.3 billion dollars - and in fact, in the region of 6.

Of these, "live money" - according to the same official data of the National Bank - only about 3, 5 billion.  Everything else is gold and special drawing rights received from the IMF last year, which cannot be used quickly and which - thanks to our campaign to block the Lukashenka regime from accessing IMF funds - can no longer be exchanged for either dollars or euros. It is hard to say what caused Lukashenka's bravado in this situation.

He probably hopes that Russia will pay for his debts.  This cannot be ruled out, given that Belarus today is actually under Russian occupation - which we announced yesterday, and the Lukashenka government is completely dependent and controlled by the Kremlin - that is, it is puppet.

However, even despite all the promises and agreements with Lukashenka, the occupying country may either not want to, or simply not be able to pay off his debts - especially in the context of the most powerful sanctions imposed against it for the war with Ukraine.  She herself found 117 million with difficulty to pay off her own debt this week.

For Belarus, which is totally indebted and completely dependent on attracting external financing, this will mean a rapid and complete collapse of the economy.  And not only creditors will suffer from it, but, first of all, ordinary people.  A large-scale crisis, inflation and devaluation of the ruble, the transfer of foreign currency deposits into rubles, and then a complete freeze of all accounts and deposits of the population, a sharp and uncontrolled rise in prices, a reduction in budget revenues, and the rejection of social support.  And Lukashenka gave his consent to all this, adopting his next odious decree on March 14.  And even earlier - by putting Belarus in total dependence on foreign loans and on Russia.

There is only one question for us, Belarusians, now - are we still ready to pay for the occupation, for the puppet government of Lukashenka and the war against Ukraine, in which this puppet government participates?  For our part, we are already doing everything to deprive the regime of any resources available to it, including through the campaign “Not a cent for war!” and the campaign initiated by us to recognize the occupation of Belarus by Russia.

  
But the faster and more decisively the Belarusians themselves act today, the sooner the occupation, lawlessness and poverty into which the puppet regime of Lukashenka has plunged our country will end.


I'm not sure how true it is about 15 warships headed to UA as well as 2 or 3 more from the waters of Japan?







I have a few ideas in what I would think would look good and cool and I assume people would wear proudly. 

I just feel like I’m trying to make a profit off of this horror. I would like to give a percentage to monetarily support UA. 

I’m just an artist that had this idea today, I haven’t thought about it much. 

I’d love to hear what your thoughts are.

I've been keeping tabs on it since it was at Sint Maarten a country in the carribean, and told some people on here it was there when asked, but since then its been going hard towards either Dubai or the black sea.

its been keeping to international waters, just outside of the borders. if ya'll want it seized possibly your last chance would be to ask Greece if it tries to pass through greek waters on its way to the black sea, or possibly if it needs feuling before then.  otherwise I fear you're gonna lose it :(

Anyone know any Greeks that could accidentally run into it while it passes Greece? would be awfully usefull if it needed to be towed into Greece for repairs after such a tragic accident.

The man who posts videos for his daughter to show he is alive posted recently. Slava Ukraini!





- The losses to the Russian forces arent viable medium term. Let alone long term. Occupation is no longer a possibility.

- The Russian airforce will never be able to operate freely in Ukraine. There wasnt even an attempt made to surpress Ukranian airspace, let alone supremacy. Any Russian aircraft is subject to effective fire, Russia is incapable of SEAD and so the air will always be contested.

- Kyiv - they no longer have the power to encircle the city, let alone assault it.

- Odessa - an initial Russian goal intended it to be the subject of an Russian ambibious assault. That assault wont happen. That says enough.

- Ukraine is being resupplied constantly from the west, whilst Ukranian forces will be severley degraded in terms of logistics and equipment, the supply seems adequate currently and the morivation of the troops seems  if anything, to be increasing.

- The Russian losses we see are primily combat means a far higher proportion of front line troops are being rendered incapacitated. Who is there to assault objectives or protect the artillery? 

To summarise...look at the UK. And the NHS. Now understand what spare capacity means. When covid hit all panic happened. Shit...people would be dying on wards. National lockdown.

But...It was about an 8% increase in beds per day...the NHS a rhobust and daily tested systrm couldnt take the strain.

This shows that a system in the modern world cannot sustain the losses Russia is taking. 

Russia, you are dead, question is whem you quit kicking.

I come here to get encouraging news. It feels really good seeing broken down Russian equipment and hearing the despair in their voice when they call back home. But I cant help but feel the dread about this whole thing. I worry that Ukraine may not be able to win this.
Hello everyone,  
We (some people in a village in germany) are currently welcoming the first refugees from Ukraine. The town administration is trying to find homes etc. Problem is: Nobody in our village speaks Ukrainian or even Russian.   
Now, a friend of mine is Russian who knows a bit of Ukrainian and she would really like to help translate. 

My question: Do you think it wise to have a native Russian talk to Ukrainian refugees in that situation? I wouldn't want to cause any harm or trauma. Those people are after all in the process of escaping from Russians so it feels kinda "weird" to confront them with someone from Russia.  


I get that this is a really hard question and I wanted to hear your opinion about that.

A second question: How widespread is the Russian language with younger Ukrainians? Most of the refugees arriving here are young(ish) women and children.  


Thank you very much 

 Слава Україні



A large portion of information has been removed from the website and has been made to look like it was abolished in 2013. When there are links still to it being one of the Russian Separatist Groups in Donbas. This feels like the Russians trying to remove anything about their Nazi groups when ever anyone points out their justifications are BS.

Didn't know where to ask so figured I might as well do so here. They are a permanent member of the security council and have a veto on various things. Considering that the vast majority of the UN is against them and everyone, including they themselves, know that they are lying and wasting everyone's time with their actions inside of the UN. How can they be kicked out of it and why on Earth is their representative still allowed to spew their lies on a regular basis?
I'm sure there are lots of subjects that ought to be in the Wiki such as information on which countries are offering residence to refugees.

Links to Ukrainian support organisations etc.

I'm sure you can think of other information that it would be useful to provide to Ukrainians looking for help and those who want to provide it.


Given the horrors piled upon the Ukrainian people by Putin’s jackbooted imperialist horde of Russian Federation terrorists, and their mercenary scumbag henchmen from abroad, it is really easy to forget that the ones doing the killing, the bombing of innocent civilians, and other war crimes, are human instead of some twisted and evil mythical monsters... 

So there is no need for magical arrows, enchanted swords, or silver bullets, the regular ones will do the job just fine. 

May Ukraine soon prevail, and the Russian Federation be broken into thousand pieces in infamy, never to rise again. 

Slava Ukraini! Heroyam Slava! 🇺🇦✊🏻




Hey, 

I'm currently in Romania working with some Ukrainian refugees and there are a couple children staying here. I'm working with a charity called Cry in the Dark who usually work with children with terminal and/or life limiting illnesses but have opened up their volunteer centre as a home for refugees.

They're pretty happy, but getting bored with the lack of structure. Everyday is the same and they have nothing to work towards. They're pretty happy staying here and don't want to move on so I wondered if - whilst they are fairly 'settled' - it might be good to get them involved with some online schooling. Just so they have some structure, something scheduled in their day, they don't get too behind and they can see other children again. I think it would help them try and feel a little more normal in this horrific time for them.

Does anyone on Reddit know of an online schooling thing that is already set up for Ukrainian children, or know of any Ukrainian/russian speaking tutors who are looking for a way to donate their time? (I think these kids speak Russian predominantly) 

Thanks 

**EDIT** 
Someone has commented that sadly this kind of post could fall into the wrong hands and be used to target organisations. 
If you do know of something along these lines but are unsure about posting or contacting me directly, feel free to check out the charity I mentioned above here https://www.cryinthedark.org/ I think it links to their social medias and you can contact them directly there.

All Accor, Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt hotels of my city now have a 1 rating with a comment that is a reminder of their support to Russia. I would invite any of you to rate just 5 or 6 their hotels on google and tripadvisor. They need to feel they did a bad choice !

Not only boycott but also show them you are shocked by such small minded people running business.

Slava Ukraini!



I support Ukraine. I definitely have questions about what happens after and what has happened before. 

Ukraine has heavy trade and heavy relations with Russia. In spite of some of the threads I have seen condemning others, the fact is Ukraine and China and Russia are large trading partners. How do you see that changing in the future? Let’s be realistic, if this war had not happened, you wouldn’t be able to criticize any company for doing business in Russia.
I was cleaning out the stables and the smelling shit reminded me about Putin, so my potato brain came up with an idea:

Installing sound systems on not yet invaded parts of cities. 

With those letting echo through the streets the following things:

 -Interviews with russian soldiers which surrendered and explain the real situation (as those which are on youtube)

 -Last audio messages from russian soldiers to their mothers (as also seen on youtube, I think even published by the ukranian government)

-Russian mothers who're calling for their sons and asking them to lay down their weapons so they won't be killed. I bet a lot of them would agree on having their voices be broadcasted through the city.
The faster this nonsense war stops, the less sons die.

The best would be that those systems are on standby and as soon infantry enters, that those can be activated. 

Russian soldiers will think about their home, their family and probably won't be able to sleep well anymore, especially the younger ones which were lied to and are sent to those "training" operations.

Maybe it's a good idea, maybe not. I'm not there so I can't tell. It's just a suggestion. If it's bs.. well then just tell me.







Realistically, how will any Russians come to be prosecuted?  Assuming the war ends in Russia retreating, one way or another, how would Ukraine or any other body physically get hold of those responsible for committing the horrific acts we see each day, if they're not POWs?  Wouldn't they simply have sanctuary in Russia?






Zhan Beleniuk is a 3 times European champion, 2 times World champion. While this can be enough for 5 people's lifetime achievements, he didn't stop there. In 2019 he was elected to the Ukrainian Parliament as part of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party.


Apparently Mr Beleniuk wasn't done yet: WHILE IN OFFICE, a successful politician, he became an Olympic Champion in Tokyo 2020. Just like that.


Which sport do you ask? Wrestling.


Today he's in Kyiv, fighting the Russian occupation.

"In response to Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the  Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and  Citizenship, today announced the launch of the Canada-Ukraine  authorization for emergency travel (CUAET). The CUAET is a special,  accelerated temporary residence pathway for Ukrainians seeking safe  haven in Canada while the war in their home country continues.

With the CUAET, Ukrainians and their immediate family members of any  nationality may stay in Canada as temporary residents for up to 3 years.  Applicants who are overseas need to apply online for a Canadian visitor  visa and provide their biometrics (fingerprints and a photo).  Applicants are encouraged to apply for a 3-year open work permit at the  same time as their visa application. This permit will allow them to work  in Canada."

My definition of the war being over is if the Russian Federation pulls its troops out. It is very likely fighting will continue in the Donetsk region of the country even after the Kremlin stops the invasion.

Thanks for any input. Stay safe

There is a Polish made site that is designed to generate random Russian cell phone numbers with a generic message designed to let the individual know the truth about what is going on with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

I don’t know if this has been discussed but what if NATO countries allow Russian soldiers who voluntarily surrender to be granted asylum and residency in the west? And maybe allow Ukrainians to pretend they were killed in action?

I am sure there are a lot of soldiers who don’t want to fight by are faced with bad options. Keep fighting and be maimed or killed. 

However, surrender means POW camp, shame back home, maybe family back home is targeted as family of a coward. You would have no future when you return to Russia. 

Even attempting to surrender or talking about it gets you shot by your leader.

Granting asylum and saying you are KIA may be a good option, or even IMPROVE your life because maybe living in some rural mud village in Russia life sucked, but being allowed to live in Norway is far better. 

Seems you could have whole units give up and surrender themselves given the option. 

Just an idea.

The artist's name is Mihály Kolodko, he is famous for installing miniature artwork all over the city. His latest piece is an erect middle finger with a ring that has the Ukrainian shield on it. On the tip of the finger, you find a russian battleship captained by a silly looking Putin. The installation is placed on a promenade named after Moscow.



Some reports that some of them were suspended I guess because of deciet.

Not sure if anyone here knows any Airbnb hosts but do you think donating money to them will actually result in it being used in a meaningful way as if it were given to a charity ?


I would like to get money from a bank account in the US to a relative in Ukraine, and have a few questions.

* Wise.com appears to be reputable, but it would require my relative providing a bank account and routing number -- and I am concerned that this might put *their* account at risk. If they were to open a new, separate account, then that would at least avoid putting their current accounts at risk. But I don't want to ask them to complete an impossible task, like opening a new account in the middle of a war zone. How possible is it right now for someone in Ukraine to open up a new bank account? 


* I asked one of my banks if I could either give them the online access info to my account, and/or if I could just mail my relative my debit card -- neither of those are allowed. 


* Venmo, cashapp, and zelle all only work with US based bank accounts, so that does not seem to be an option. 


* Wiring money directly is another option, but again runs into the problem that the recipient needs to provide account information. 


Are there any other reputable and safe options for getting money from the US to Ukraine?





I’m not at all well informed on the issue, but are there any significant separatist movements with Russia, and could those be exploited in the same way Russia has exploited separatist movements in Georgia, Moldova and Donbas? I realise this wouldn’t be an overnight thing, and nor do I mean that they should be “colonised” by a “western” nation but maybe such regional movements could be backed financially and (longer term) militarily.


Canada welcomes an unlimited number of refugees. They can go to Canada even if they don't have a passport. It takes about two weeks to complete the process.

Two facts are clear today:

1.) The Russian military has shown to be a paper tiger, a mere shadow of its supposed military might in the days of the USSR. If they’re struggling to take ground against a far smaller country and military, they cannot hope to reconstitute the former USSR to any degree via military means.

2.) Putin went on state TV today and declared that a “purge” of dissenters from Russian society is now necessary.

These are the signs that his grip on power is severely weakened to the degree that he’s lashing out.

We have to remember all of the first responders who are in the middle of this war. They arrive on scene within minutes of the bombings and never second guess themselves by putting their lives on the line to save others. These men and woman are running calls 24/7 and have to be exhausted. You are not forgotten and are such an important element in this terrible war. We salute you and prey for all of your safety.
So Russia is starting to apply their new law against dissidents.

The last time they did that was when the Bolsheviks defaulted on Tsarist Russia's war debt.

Fun story: in the 80s, a wealth management firm called Carl Marks sued the USSR to make good on those bonds


The UK govt is launching a new visa scheme: British residents and organisations can sponsor Ukrainians to get a UK visa, provided they can offer the Ukrainian national somewhere to stay for a few months.

Info here in Ukrainian, English and Russian:  [https://sites.google.com/view/ua2ukhelp/ru](https://sites.google.com/view/ua2ukhelp/ru?fbclid=IwAR1f2CsWHIfPh_he7hs0SektTDrYCm61ovN2L4gPApO7d-aduqNfmmKD81c)   

Spread the word to any British residents you might know, and any Ukrainians who need somewhere to go.  


British residents who could host Ukrainians but don¨'t know any, leave a comment below.






German Bild has published a news article:

&gt; # Giant mystery about Lavrov's flight
&gt;
&gt;Is that a red flag? Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (71) actually wanted to fly to his big ally in Beijing on Thursday night. But in the middle of the flight, his plane turned back halfway over Novosibirsk (Siberia)! Instead of going to China, it was the 2800 kilometers as the crow flies back to the departure airport in Moscow Vnukovo.  
&gt;  
&gt;And the world is puzzled: didn't Beijing want to receive Putin's foreign minister (Western nickname: lying Lavrov), or did Putin order him back because the hut in Moscow was on fire?  
&gt;  
&gt;Because the previous day was explosive: Putin himself had announced in an anti-Western perseverance speech that he would continue in Ukraine "to the end". He had accused the West of wanting to "smash" and "abolish" his country. Russia will be "sent to the afterlife", should be "turned into a weak, dependent country" and "in the best case" be dismembered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then came the mega announcement from the USA: President Joe Biden promised Ukraine massive deliveries of military aid: weapons and equipment worth almost a billion dollars!  
&gt;  
&gt;And Putin announced days ago that he would react to the arms deliveries from the West for his opponent Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;So is a new level of escalation on the part of Russia imminent?  
&gt;  
&gt;Or Beijing did not want to receive Lavrov? Finally, according to US reports, Moscow had asked Beijing for both financial and military aid. Although Beijing is covering up Putin's war against Ukraine, it has not actively supported the invasion so far.  
&gt;  
&gt;In response to a question from journalists, US President Biden described Putin as a “war criminal”. Russian state media then pointed out that almost a year ago, when asked whether Putin was a murderer, Biden had answered in the affirmative.  
&gt;  
&gt;And the world is wondering what the cancellation of the trip to China means for the war in Ukraine and the situation in the Kremlin...

I know this info is around, but feel as though Americans have a LOT of room, and we want to help.

I thought a post here might make the info easier to find, if it's possible!

With the huge quantity of arms that are being shipped into Ukraine, and with Russia saying that the convoys will be targets, what steps are the Ukrainians taking to make sure the weapons aren't destroyed in transit or captured?
